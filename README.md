# Medical_Reservation_FX
Another tiny Java program where you have methods that manipulate data in order to take reservations for exams and appointments with meds!

Keep in mind that the methods will work with a FX app, but you need to build it yourself!

Main operations:
- print list of meds
- print list of patients
- print patients' reservations
- print meds' appointments
- take reservations

Enjoy!
